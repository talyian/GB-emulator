   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-10-19 Sat 12:24]
   marking as "done" for now. Need to revisit for the RTC.
** TODO RTC - MBC3
** DOING Blargg instr_timing
currently the test fails init_timer since our timer is way off.
we'll need to emit accurate cycle counts for all the instructions used in
the delay loop before init_timer can pass and we can actually test_timer

The current instruction decoder is too abstracted. we can simplify by
removing the opcodes.inc python generator stuff.

As a side-effect, this improved the instruction timings enough that Kirby and Links Awakening work. 

** DONE DMG Palettes

   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-10-18 Fri 20:59]
done - Links Awakening Intro works now

** DONE Render Window

** DONE Sprite Flip/Rotation bug
   CLOSED: [2019-10-18 Fri 23:50]
It was an issue with 8x16 sprites; need to flip the entire 16-pixel
sprite when flipY is on

** TODO Sound
** TODO CGB Features
** DONE Handle DMA (FF46)
** DONE Skip Bootstrap
** TODO Test Harness
** TODO Bug: windows build doesn't load bgbtest anymore, perhaps due to corruption
** DONE WASM platform doesn't run Kirby/Zelda etc when Win32 does

   - State "DONE"       from "DOING"      [2019-10-19 Sat 12:23]
   Turns out that localstorage encoding is broken. need to find some eficient way
   to do hex or base64 encoding.
