   marking as "done" for now. Need to revisit for the RTC.
** TODO RTC - MBC3
   Partially done. implemented spgb_get_timestamp() so that the game actually loads
   and increment the timer registers.

   the new executor is fantastic. bugfix to timer frequency and some
   edits related to LoadHL and all tests pass.

   - State "DONE"       from "DOING"      [2019-10-17 Thu 17:50]
The current instruction decoder is too abstracted. we can simplify by
removing the opcodes.inc python generator stuff.

As a side-effect, this improved the instruction timings enough that Kirby and Links Awakening work. 

** DONE DMG Palettes

   CLOSED: [2019-10-18 Fri 23:50]

   Turns out that localstorage encoding is broken. need to find some eficient way
   to do hex or base64 encoding.

  CLOSED: [2019-10-27 Sun 01:47]
  I was loading the wrong Bios: should I always the load the CGB bios, even for DMG roms?
* TODO BUG: bgbtest audio notes play too long
