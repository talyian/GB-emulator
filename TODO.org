** DONE Memory Banking - MBC1
** TODO Memory Banking - MBC3
** DOING Blargg instr_timing
currently the test fails init_timer since our timer is way off.
we'll need to emit accurate cycle counts for all the instructions used in
the delay loop before init_timer can pass and we can actually test_timer

** DOING New Instruction Decoder
The current instruction decoder is too abstracted. we can simplify by
removing the opcodes.inc python generator stuff
